## Overview
In this project, I have built an initial artificial intelligence model by incorporating basic teachings for regression and classification. I have also included examples of the results obtained in the form of plots and images. The project is based on a Kaggle dataset that focuses on the monetary value of various nations, and it performs a prediction task. For further details, please refer to the accompanying PDF document.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a publicly available Kaggle dataset that provides information on the monetary value of different countries. It consists of a large number of features and can be used for various prediction tasks.

## Conclusion
Overall, this project provides a basic introduction to artificial intelligence and regression/classification models. It also demonstrates how to work with a real-world dataset and perform a prediction task. I hope that this project will be helpful to those who are new to the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning.
